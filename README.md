# KeyExchangeProtocol
Implementing a Key Exchange Protocol using Isogenies on Elliptic Curves in Python by Thomas Schwartzenburg. Senior mathematics capstone project.

In order to run this key exchange, first run bob.py as the server and then alice.py as the client. alice.py will require two command-line arguments: the IP address of the server and the port number (12000).
